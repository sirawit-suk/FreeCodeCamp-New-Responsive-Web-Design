## Tips
### Guidelines for names
- [Filenames and file types](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames)
  - Recommended: avoiding-cliches.jd (don't use underscores).
- [File Naming Conventions](https://www.rothschillermd.com/file-naming-conventions/)
  - Underscores ( _ ) are no longer used per ISO 8601, uses hyphens instead
  - Begin with a letter, not a number.
- [This is the Best URL Structure for SEO (dash vs underscore)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVh8_TwAF70)
  - use dash (-) as google recommended.

### Git commit message
- [Writing Meaningful Commit Messages](https://reflectoring.io/meaningful-commit-messages/#:~:text=Commit%20messages%20are%20a%20way,changes%20related%20to%20a%20bug.)
    - **Right:** fix: add authorization for document access

### Obsolete closing tag in HTML 5
- [Self-Closing Tag](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31857/self-closing-tag#:~:text=A%20self%2Dclosing%20tag%20is,tag%20enclosed%20in%20sideways%20carets.)
  -  W3C rules and other standards show that developers no longer need to include the character to indicate a closing tag
-  [Is the Ending Slash Optional?](https://www.scaler.com/topics/self-closing-tags-in-html/)
   -  HTML5: Using a slash is absolutely optional.

### Wait...What?
- [lesson vs topics](https://asklexph.com/lesson-vs-topics/)
  - lesson always has topic inside.
