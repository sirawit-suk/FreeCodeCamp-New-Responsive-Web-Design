## Tips
### Guidelines for names
- [Filenames and file types](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames)
  - Recommended: avoiding-cliches.jd (don't use underscores).
- [File Naming Conventions](https://www.rothschillermd.com/file-naming-conventions/)
  - Underscores ( _ ) are no longer used per ISO 8601, uses hyphens instead
  - Begin with a letter, not a number.
- [This is the Best URL Structure for SEO (dash vs underscore)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVh8_TwAF70)
  - use dash (-) as google recommended.

### Wait...What?
- [lesson vs topics](https://asklexph.com/lesson-vs-topics/)
  - lesson always has topic inside.
